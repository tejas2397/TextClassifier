To Build A text classifier which uses the movie reviews from nltk.corpus.The text classifier uses Basic & advanced preprocessing to clean the data for preparing the classifier.
The classifier uses a bag of words to model and the naive bayes algorithm to predict the sentiment of the review.
In this repository 2 python files have been added namely'movie_review.py'&'movie_review1.py'.The second file has shows correct result in any case of the input while the first file shows negative review most of the time.
The first python code uses TOP-N words model while other uses a proper BAG OF WORDS model for model building.
The CORRECT RESPONSE CAN BE OBTAINED USING THE FIE NAMED ""movie_review1.py"".
